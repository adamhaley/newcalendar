MEAN Stack app, scheduling calendar for Jack & Jeri's Gym

"M" in this case is for "MySQL" since I built this on top of a  MySQL DB.

Instructions:

1)npm install
2)create a mysql db and import jjgym_calendar_new.sql into it.
3)place a .env file with your MySQL connex info for that db in the root dir (same dir as app.js)

.env example:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=jjgym_calendar
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root

4)grunt
(optional) for css development.
compiles stylus to css and re-compiles on changes

5)node app.js
